% Kite programming language!

% we can access printf and exit because the object file is linked with GCC
extern printf
extern exit

global main

% main "routine", this will be translated to main label in the assembly, so this
% is the entry point
routine main {
	call printf("%d", (1 + 2) * 3)
	call exit(0)
}
